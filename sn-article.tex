\abstract{
    This paper presents an investigation into the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, a cellular automaton model used for simulating traffic flow, with a focus on understanding traffic dynamics at intersections. By extending the model to incorporate traffic signals, we explore the effects of different signal patterns and control strategies on overall traffic flow efficiency. The study aims to provide insights into the optimal management of traffic signals at intersections, leading to improved road safety and reduced travel times. Through simulation scenarios and analysis, we evaluate various traffic signal control strategies and assess their impact on key metrics such as vehicle throughput, average travel time, queue lengths, and congestion levels. The findings contribute to our understanding of traffic flow behavior at intersections and offer implications for traffic management and planning. The limitations of the cellular automaton model are discussed, and suggestions for future research in traffic flow modeling and intersection management are provided. This research provides a foundation for developing efficient traffic management techniques and informing sustainable urban mobility planning.

\section{Equations}

Equations in \LaTeX{} can either be inline or on-a-line by itself. For
inline equations use the \verb+$...$+ commands. Eg: The equation
$H\psi = E \psi$ is written via the command $H \psi = E \psi$.

For on-a-line by itself equations (with auto generated equation numbers)
one can use the equation or eqnarray environments \textit{D}.
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = i {\psi} \gamma^\mu D_\mu \psi
    - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a\mu\nu} - m {\psi} \psi
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{align}
D_\mu &=  \partial_\mu - ig \frac{\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\mu
\nonumber \\
F^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu
    + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^a_\nu
\label{eq2}
\end{align}
Notice the use of \verb+\nonumber+ in the align environment at the end
of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on
lines where no equation numbers are required. The \verb+\label{}+ command
should only be used at the last line of an align environment where
\verb+\nonumber+ is not used.
\begin{equation}
Y_\infty = \left( \frac{m}{\textrm{GeV}} \right)^{-3}
    \left[ 1 + \frac{3 \ln(m/\textrm{GeV})}{15}
    + \frac{\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \right]
\end{equation}
The class file also supports the use of \verb+\mathbb{}+, \verb+\mathscr{}+ and
\verb+\mathcal{}+ commands. As such \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathscr{R}+
and \verb+\mathcal{R}+ produces $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathscr{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}$
respectively.

\section{Figures}

As per the \LaTeX\ standards eps images in \verb!latex! and pdf/jpg/png images in
\verb!pdflatex! should be used. This is one of the major differences between \verb!latex!
and \verb!pdflatex!. The images should be single page documents. The command for inserting images
for latex and pdflatex can be generalized. The package that should be used
is the graphicx package.

\begin{figure}[t]%
\FIG{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Fig}}
{\caption{This is a widefig. This is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption  this is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption}
\label{fig1}}
\end{figure}



\section{Tables}

Tables can be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put
footnotes inside tables one has to use the additional ``fntable" environment
enclosing the tabular environment. The footnote appears just below the table
itself.

\begin{table}[t]
\tabcolsep=0pt%
\TBL{\caption{Tables which are too long to fit,
should be written using the ``table*'' environment as~shown~here\label{tab2}}}
{\begin{fntable}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcccccc@{}}\toprule%
 & \multicolumn{3}{@{}c@{}}{\TCH{Element 1}}& \multicolumn{3}{@{}c@{}}{\TCH{Element 2\smash{\footnotemark[1]}}}
 \\\cmidrule{2-4}\cmidrule{5-7}%
\TCH{Projectile} & \TCH{Energy} & \TCH{$\sigma_{\mathit{calc}}$} & \TCH{$\sigma_{\mathit{expt}}$} &
\TCH{Energy} & \TCH{$\sigma_{\mathit{calc}}$} & \TCH{$\sigma_{\mathit{expt}}$} \\\midrule
\TCH{Element 3}&990 A &1168 &$1547\pm12$ &780 A &1166 &$1239\pm100$\\
{\TCH{Element 4}}&500 A &961 &$\hphantom{0}922\pm10$ &900 A &1268 &$1092\pm40\hphantom{0}$\\
\botrule
\end{tabular*}%
\footnotetext[]{{Note:} This is an example of table footnote this is an example of table footnote this is an example of table footnote this is an example of~table footnote this is an example of table footnote}
\footnotetext[1]{This is an example of table footnote}%
\end{fntable}}
\end{table}



\section{Cross referencing}

Environments such as figure, table, equation, align can have a label
declared via the \verb+\label{#label}+ command. For figures and table
environments one should use the \verb+\label{}+ command inside or just
below the \verb+\caption{}+ command.  One can then use the
\verb+\ref{#label}+ command to cross-reference them. As an example, consider
the label declared for Figure \ref{fig1} which is
\verb+\label{fig1}+. To cross-reference it, use the command
\verb+ Figure \ref{fig1}+, for which it comes up as
``Figure \ref{fig1}''.
The reference citations should used as per the ``natbib'' packages. Some sample citations:  \cite{bib1,bib2,bib3,bib4,bib5}.

\section{Lists}

List in \LaTeX{} can be of three types: enumerate, itemize and description.
In each environments, new entry is added via the \verb+\item+ command.
Enumerate creates numbered lists, itemize creates bulleted lists and
description creates description lists.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item First item in the number list.
\item Second item in the number list.
\item Third item in the number list.
\end{enumerate}
